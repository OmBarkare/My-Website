### Who am I ?
I am **Om Barkare**, Student at **IIITDM Jabalpur**.
I like learning about new technologies. Currently I am exploring the web3 space as there are many things here that I find interesting and transmormative, such as ZK-proofs, trustless transactions, consensus mechanisms.. and many more.
