I am a person who thinks big and hesitates to take action. I make a lot of plans, but then not execute them at all.
After a lot of thinking, I have realized the root this problem. I am *scared*. Scared of *wasting* time in *learning* something that I think might not be useful later on. I am scared of executing a wrong or bad decision, and end up doing nothing at all.

I focus to much on the end goal and in thinking how to reach there, that I end up only thinking and actually doing nothing.

I romanticize complexitiy too much. I am scared of doing *simple* things. Things that everyone does. I am afraid that if I am doing what everyone does, then what special skill do *I* have ? But in doing so, I have missed out on doing those simple things that I should have known.

So, this website is a revolt against myself. I am making a website, something simple that almost everyone does.
